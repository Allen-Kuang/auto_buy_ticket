# auto_buy_ticket
Use python pyautogui library to help you buy ticket automatically.

## Installation
Before we start, we need to install 3 libraries. 
1. pip install pyautogui
2. pip install opencv_python
3. pip install jupyter

## Start Jupyter notebook
First, we need to start jupyter notebook, which is a code editor.

Input ```jupyter notebook``` in your terminal, it will start.

You can use 'get_position.ipynb' to get the position of your cursor on you screen. It will be very helpful when opencv doesn't work.

## How to use test demo - tennis_ticket.ipynb
First, you need to open this link in you browser - https://bawtt.ydmap.cn/venue/bawt-h5?mapId=103071.

Attention: This demo is related to your computer screen size(My computer screen is 13 inch). If your computer screen size isn't 13 inch, this program maybe not work, you need to adjust the parameters(x,y position) of the program.

And then, run those code blocks one by one, you will see the affect.

Good luck to you, no thanks~
